# Petful Client

A fifo adoption site built on react! https://petful-nine.now.sh/ (server side: https://github.com/thinkful-ei-leopard/Petful-Server-Lillian-Christopher)

When you go to the adoption page, you can see others that are in line before you and every 5 seconds the person at the front of the line will adopt randomly a cat or dog. When you put in your name you'll be entered in line and when you get to the front of the line you're able to choose to adopt a dog or a cat. You'll be able to see people adopting pets behind you after this.

##Why adopt First in First out?

Many pets are passed up at traditional adoption centers for superficial reasons, for example, black cats have the lowest adoption rate and can end up at a shelter for years! ALL of our pets can make wonderful additions to your family so we give them an equal chance at adoption.



##Great! How do I adopt?

Head on over to https://petful-nine.now.sh/ and go to the adoption page, put your name in line and adopt a dog or cat!
